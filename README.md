## About

PyNote is a text editor application written in Python and PyQt5.  The basic application will be able to create and load text files, update the text within those files, and save the resulting changes.  Once the basic application is completed, future features will include UI updates, code modules (Python, Markdown, etc.), writing modules(novels, screenplays, etc.), and other feature requests.

The purpose of this project is to

- Improve project collaboration & management skills
- Learn how to build graphical user interfaces with PyQt5
- Gain experience in Python
