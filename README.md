## About

PyNote is a text editor application written in Python and Tkinter.  The basic application will be able to create and load text files, update the text within those files, and save the resulting changes.  Once the basic application is completed, future features will include UI updates, code modules (Python, Markdown, etc.), writing modules (novels, screenplays, etc.), and other feature requests.
